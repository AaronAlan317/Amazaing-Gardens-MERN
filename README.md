# Amazaing-Gardens-MERN

## Description

This application was made using the MERN stack and is to help with growing and managing plants.
A packet of seeds contains a lot of information including information regarding planting instructions, description of the plant, days to germination,
growing zones, and plant height. There is a lot of information to keep track of when it comes to growing and caring for plants and having an application that can manage this can be very useful. Some motivation for this application is to create a database of plant information that can be used to make better planting decisions.

This project is broken up into two folders, client and server. The client folder contains the react frontend, and the server folder contains the express backend.
For deployment purposes, the server is hosted on Heroku, while the client is deployed using Netlify.

## Testing

The project can be accessed at https://amazing-gardens.netlify.app/ .

To run the project locally open up two terminals for each folder and inside them run:
```
npm install
npm start
```

## What's Next

Input validation and styling need to be worked on.

Future features will include user authorization, to allow multiple people to save their plant information. More tools, such as a planting scheduler 
are being developed.
